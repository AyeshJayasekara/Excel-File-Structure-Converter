# Excel-File-Structure-Converter
This is a simple yet powerful program I wrote to read an Excel file and its contents to generate an anther Excel file with different structure. In the mean time it will also derive postal codes of given addresses (Sri Lankan postal codes only).

NOTE : You will have to change the file name of your source Excel file otherwise a "File IO" Exception will be raised.
